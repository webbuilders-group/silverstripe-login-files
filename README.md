SilverStripe Login Files
=================
Changes how assets in SilverStripe 4.x that require a logged in user are handled by redirecting them to login rather than returning a page not found while keeping draft assets as a page not found. Restoring similar behavior to that of [silverstripe/secureassets](https://github.com/silverstripe/silverstripe-secureassets).
